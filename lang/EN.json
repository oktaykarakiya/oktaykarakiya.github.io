    "about_me_text": "Hello, I am a young and enthusiastic programmer with a deep passion for software development. I possess a wide range of programming skills, including expertise in CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Node.js, C and C++, Haskell, C#, and .NET. Additionally, I am fluent in English, German, Italian, and Turkish, which allows me to communicate effectively with people from different parts of the world. My motivation for pursuing a career in software development is to become financially independent and potentially move to another country. I am a calm and quick learner who always gives their best effort, and I take pride in my precise and tidy work. I have a deep critical reasoning mind and strong communication skills, which enable me to think deeply about problems and come up with creative solutions while effectively collaborating with my colleagues and clients. While my long-term career plans are not yet clear, I am excited to explore new possibilities and seize opportunities that align with my interests and aspirations. In my free time, I enjoy experimenting with new technologies and expanding my skillset. I am confident that my passion, skills, and dedication will enable me to succeed in any software development role I pursue.",
